For purposes of this instruction:(i) Acquired Fund expenses include increases resulting from brokerage service and expense offset arrangements and reductions resulting from fee waivers or reimbursements by the Acquired Funds\' investment advisers or sponsors; and (ii) Acquired Fund expenses do not include expenses (i.e., performance fees) that are incurred solely upon the realization and/or distribution of a gain.
